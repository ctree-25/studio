/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules for CourtConnect
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership and role-based model. Users have full control over their own data (like their profile), while interactions between different user types (like a coach giving feedback to a player) are governed by specific authorization checks. The primary goal is to ensure data privacy and integrity while allowing for public discovery of profiles.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into four top-level collections: `/users`, `/playerProfiles`, `/coaches`, and `/coachFeedback`. This flat structure simplifies rules by avoiding complex path traversals, but it relies heavily on denormalized IDs within documents for authorization checks.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Profile Visibility**: Player and Coach profiles (`/playerProfiles`, `/coaches`) are publicly readable to allow for discovery within the app. However, write access is strictly limited to the profile owner.
 * - **User Listing Disabled**: To protect user privacy, it is not possible to list all documents in the `/users` collection.
 * - **Feedback Privacy**: Feedback in `/coachFeedback` is private and can only be read by the coach who wrote it or the player who received it.
 * - **Default Deny**: Any access not explicitly granted by these rules is denied.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * To create simpler and more performant rules, this ruleset relies on denormalized data. For example:
 * - The `/playerProfiles/{profileId}` document contains a `userId` field. This allows rules to verify ownership directly (`resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`) without performing a costly and slow `get()` on another document.
 * - Similarly, `/coachFeedback` documents contain both a `coachId` and a `playerId`, allowing rules to grant access to the correct two parties without extra lookups.
 *
 * ## Structural Segregation
 * Data is logically separated into distinct top-level collections based on its purpose and access patterns (e.g., public profiles vs. private feedback). This is more secure and performant than mixing public and private data in a single collection.
