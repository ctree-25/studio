/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules for CourtConnect
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership and role-based model. Users have full control over their own data (like their profile), while interactions between different user types (like a coach giving feedback to a player) are governed by specific authorization checks. The primary goal is to ensure data privacy and integrity while allowing for public discovery of profiles.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into three top-level collections: `/users`, `/playerProfiles`, and `/coaches`. The `/coaches` collection contains an `assessments` sub-collection. This structure simplifies rules by tying assessment data directly to the coach who created it.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Profile Visibility**: Player and Coach profiles (`/playerProfiles`, `/coaches`) are publicly readable to allow for discovery within the app. However, write access is strictly limited to the profile owner.
 * - **Assessment Creation**: Only the owning coach can create an assessment in their own sub-collection.
 * - **Assessment Visibility**: An assessment can only be read by the player it belongs to, or the coach who wrote it.
 * - **Default Deny**: Any access not explicitly granted by these rules is denied.
