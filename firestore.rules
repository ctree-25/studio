/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules for CourtConnect
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership and role-based model. Users have full control over their own data (like their profile), while interactions between different user types (like a coach giving feedback to a player) are governed by specific authorization checks. The primary goal is to ensure data privacy and integrity while allowing for public discovery of profiles.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into four top-level collections: `/users`, `/playerProfiles`, `/coaches`, and `/assessments`. This flat structure simplifies rules by avoiding complex path traversals.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Profile Visibility**: Player and Coach profiles (`/playerProfiles`, `/coaches`) are publicly readable to allow for discovery within the app. However, write access is strictly limited to the profile owner.
 * - **Assessment Creation**: Only authenticated coaches can create new assessments.
 * - **Assessment Visibility**: An assessment can only be read by the player it belongs to, or the coach who wrote it.
 * - **Default Deny**: Any access not explicitly granted by these rules is denied.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * To create simpler and more performant rules, this ruleset relies on denormalized data. For example, the `/playerProfiles/{profileId}` document contains a `userId` field, allowing rules to verify ownership directly (`resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`) without performing a costly `get()`.
 *
 * ## Structural Segregation
 * Data is logically separated into distinct top-level collections based on its purpose and access patterns (e.g., public profiles vs. private data). This is more secure and performant than mixing public and private data in a single collection.
